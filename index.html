                        <h2>What is Philosophy</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            Philosophy is a branch of knowledge that explores fundamental questions about the nature of
                            reality, existence,
                            knowledge, ethics, and the meaning and purpose of life. It is a discipline that employs
                            critical thinking and rational
                            inquiry to examine these profound and abstract concepts
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The word "philosophy" is derived from the Greek terms "philos," meaning "love," and
                            "sophia," meaning "wisdom." Thus,
                            philosophy can be understood as the love and pursuit of wisdom. Philosophers engage in
                            rigorous analysis, logical
                            reasoning, and contemplation to understand the fundamental principles that underlie the
                            universe and human existence.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Through philosophical inquiry, philosophers seek to address fundamental questions such as:
                            What is the nature of
                            reality? What can we know, and how can we acquire knowledge? What is the basis for moral and
                            ethical judgments? What is
                            the nature of consciousness and the mind? What is the meaning and purpose of life? These
                            inquiries often involve
                            rigorous analysis, critical examination of assumptions, and consideration of diverse
                            perspectives.

                        <h2>Western and Eastern Philosophy</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            Eastern and Western philosophy represent distinct philosophical traditions that have evolved
                            in different regions and
                            cultures. Western philosophy, with its roots in ancient Greece, focuses on individualism,
                            rationality, and logical
                            analysis. It places a strong emphasis on the individual's rights, autonomy, and the pursuit
                            of truth through systematic
                            reasoning. Western philosophy has explored various branches such as metaphysics,
                            epistemology, ethics, and political
                            philosophy, often employing analytical and critical thinking methods.
                        </p>
                       
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In contrast, Eastern philosophy encompasses diverse traditions like Indian, Chinese, and
                            Japanese philosophy. It
                            emphasizes harmony, interconnectedness, and spiritual development. Eastern philosophy often
                            explores concepts such as
                            karma, enlightenment, and the dissolution of dualistic distinctions. It tends to prioritize
                            the collective over the
                            individual, emphasizing social harmony, communal values, and the interdependence of
                            individuals within a larger whole.
                            Eastern philosophy frequently employs contemplative and intuitive approaches, with practices
                            like meditation and
                            self-reflection being key components. Time is often perceived cyclically or as an illusion,
                            and the focus is on the
                            present moment and the interconnectedness of all things
                        </p>
