                    Philosophy is a branch of knowledge that explores fundamental questions about the nature of reality, existence,
                    knowledge, ethics, and the meaning and purpose of life. It is a discipline that employs critical thinking and rational
                    inquiry to examine these profound and abstract concepts

                <p>
                    The word "philosophy" is derived from the Greek terms "philos," meaning "love," and "sophia," meaning "wisdom." Thus,
                    philosophy can be understood as the love and pursuit of wisdom. Philosophers engage in rigorous analysis, logical
                    reasoning, and contemplation to understand the fundamental principles that underlie the universe and human existence.

                <p>
                    Through philosophical inquiry, philosophers seek to address fundamental questions such as: What is the nature of
                    reality? What can we know, and how can we acquire knowledge? What is the basis for moral and ethical judgments? What is
                    the nature of consciousness and the mind? What is the meaning and purpose of life? These inquiries often involve
                    rigorous analysis, critical examination of assumptions, and consideration of diverse perspectives.

                <h2>Western and Eastern Philosophy</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Eastern and Western philosophy represent distinct philosophical traditions that have evolved in different regions and
                    cultures. Western philosophy, with its roots in ancient Greece, focuses on individualism, rationality, and logical
                    analysis. It places a strong emphasis on the individual's rights, autonomy, and the pursuit of truth through systematic
                    reasoning. Western philosophy has explored various branches such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and political
                    philosophy, often employing analytical and critical thinking methods.

                <p>
                    In contrast, Eastern philosophy encompasses diverse traditions like Indian, Chinese, and Japanese philosophy. It
                    emphasizes harmony, interconnectedness, and spiritual development. Eastern philosophy often explores concepts such as
                    karma, enlightenment, and the dissolution of dualistic distinctions. It tends to prioritize the collective over the
                    individual, emphasizing social harmony, communal values, and the interdependence of individuals within a larger whole.
                    Eastern philosophy frequently employs contemplative and intuitive approaches, with practices like meditation and
                    self-reflection being key components. Time is often perceived cyclically or as an illusion, and the focus is on the
                    present moment and the interconnectedness of all things
